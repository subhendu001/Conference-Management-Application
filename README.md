# Conference-Management-Application
A conference management application will be created to manage all aspects of a conference that includes basically 3 objects and each object is having some well defined features.
 1. Session: To know what are the sessions that are scheduled.
 2. Speakers: To know who are the speakers for different session.
 3. Hotels : what are the nearest hotels available to arrange the conference center.
 4. Hotel Map: Help the speaker to reach to the scheduled center. I used google API which takes coordinates and plots the same over map.
